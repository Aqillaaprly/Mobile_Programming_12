# Practicum 12 : Stream
## Practical 6 : StreamBuilder
### Question 13
**Explain what is in step 3 and 7!**
 * Step 3 creates a stream that emits a new random number (0-9) every single second, indefinitely.
 * Step 7 tells the app to listen to the number stream. Every time a new random number arrives (once per second), the StreamBuilder automatically rebuilds the Text widget to show that new number.
